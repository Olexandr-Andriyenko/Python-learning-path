# Data structures

Data structures can be imagined as structures that hold some data together. In other words, they are used to store a collection of related data. There are three built-in data structures in Python - lists, tuples, and dictionaries. We will see how each of these three data structures can be used and how they simplify our lives at programing.

## Lists

A list is a data structure that contains an ordered collection of objects (variables are references to objects). This means that in a list you can store a sequence (a sequence) of objects (variables).You can imagine it like a shopping list, which is a list of things to buy, except that on your shopping list you probably have the things on separate lines. While in Python commas must be placed between the objects.
