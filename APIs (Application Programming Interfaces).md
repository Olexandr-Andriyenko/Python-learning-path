# APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

They all are a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects
that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.
<br>
<br>
Essentially, the API is an interface or rather a sort of barrier between your program and an external system.
And what you're trying to do is you're trying to use the rules that the API has
prescribed to make a request to the external system for some piece of data.
And if you have structured your request
according to all of the requirements that this external system has set out in
their API, then they will respond to you appropriately and give you the data that you want.

So if we think about some examples, Yahoo weather has a Yahoo
weather API
which you can tap into using your programs or apps and get things like 10-day
forecast, wind, atmosphere, astronomy conditions,
and Coinbase has their own API,
which lets you tap into the current live prices of various cryptocurrencies.
