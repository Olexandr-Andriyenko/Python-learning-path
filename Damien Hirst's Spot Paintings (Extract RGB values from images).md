<img src="https://github.com/Olexandr-Andriyenko/Python-learning-path/blob/main/illustrations/img38.png" width="400">
<p>  

The estimated price for this art is around [Â£350,000 - 550,00](https://www.phillips.com/detail/damien-hirst/UK010122/38).
<br>
<br>
We will create a Python code to find out the color palette of the image.<br>
After that we will use this color palette to create such a similar art.
<br>
<br>
For this project we will use the package [colorgram](https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/).
First step is to install "colorgram.py". For this go in pycharm to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Project:...` -> `Python Interpreter` -> press the `+` symbol -> search "colorgram.py" and install it.
