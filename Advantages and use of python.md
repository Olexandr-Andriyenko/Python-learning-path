# Advantages and use of python

Before learning a programming language, you should be aware of what you can apply the programming language for and which advantages the programming language brings.
When you get to know a new tool, such as a a Phillips screwdriver, you also first find out what you can do with it and what advantages it has compared to other screwdrivers.Therefore, the advantages as well as applications of Python are listed here:


- Python is especially suitable for beginners and can be learned quickly compared to to other programming languages
- Python is completely free
- Python has a wide range of applications, so you don't have to specialize in one area (web development, data science...) right away.
- A very simple and clear syntax, which can be memorized very quickly
- Trivial tasks can be automated very quickly without much effort
- Python is very popular in the Data Science and Machine Learning area
- Python has a very large community, which means that all questions concerning Python can be answered quickly on the Internet
- Python has a predefined structured programming style
- Object-oriented programming is also supported
- Uses less source code than other programming languages
- Many libraries exist
- Independent of the operating system
- Gets by with relatively few keywords
- Suitable for particularly fast development of programs. For this reason very popular in the RAD area (Rapid Application Development)
- No semicolon at the end of the line, as for example with Java necessary
- Specification of data types for variables not necessary (dynamically typed)
- Simple games are easy to develop

This list can be strongly continued, but it should be enough examples of the advantages and application areas in Python for the beginning. If you are a beginner, don't worry if some terms are not known in the list. Over time, we will look more closely at the subject areas and the terms that belong to them, and provide clear definitions.
