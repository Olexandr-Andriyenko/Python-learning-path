# Modules

In simple words, a Python module is simply a file that contains pre-written Python code. In principle, each Python script can be seen as a Python module in its own way.
In practice, modules are primarily used to make it easier to organize the source code of a larger software project and to keep it clear. A general rule is that a module should only be so large that its contents and purpose can be summarized in one or two sentences. Each module represents a separate namespace for variables, so that functions with the same name defined in different modules do not cause conflicts. Module names are generally written in lowercase in Python.

With the installation of python many modules are already included. If you want to list all available modules, you have to open the PYTHON CONSOLE and type "help("modules")". The console will show you all intealled modules, of course you can add latter new modules.
