# Guess-The-Number-Game

Build a game which creats a random number and the player have to guess this number.<br>
But the player have 5 tries at the "hard" mode and 10 tries at the "easy" mode.<br>
Every time of the guess is wrong, the player lose a live (try) until he has 0 tries.<br>
Of course at 0 tries the game is over an the playe lost the game.<br>
If the playe do a guess the program should tell the user if the guess is to high or to low, so the player can get a better estimation of the number<br>
