# Input and output


A computer works according to the IPO principle (input-processing-output). Input data from a computer is processed by a program and then output data is generated, which is then displayed by the computer to the user. To illustrate this principle, consider the following example:
<br>
- A person enters information into a program, on the computer through the keyboard, which is available in the computer as data (input). 
- Then, inside the program, the text can be processed so that the font size is adjusted or the color of the text is changed (processing). 
- Then the user decides to print this text or display it as an image on the screen (output).

Since you are consistently dealing with the input, processing, and output of data, it is important to know how to input and output data in Python. For this we will learn two important functions "print()" and "input()".
