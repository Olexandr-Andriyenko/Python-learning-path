# Snake game

Create the classic game snake! Study the [rules and the gameplay of snake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(Computerspiel)) and rebuild it by yourself.<br>
Use for this project the "turtle" module.
<br>
<br>
You can solve the project in many small steps:
- Create a snake body (created by three turtles)
- Move the snake (read about the [tracer](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.tracer) method and use the [update method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.update) to update the screen. Also you need to read about the [sleep method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep))
- Create snake food
- Detect collision with food
- Create a scoreboard
- Detect collision with wall
- Detect collision with tail

Idea how the movement of the snake can be created:
