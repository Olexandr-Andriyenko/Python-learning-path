# Conditionals

Control structures are used to determine which parts of the code should be executed. You will hardly be able to write a useful program without any kind of conditions. As a rule, every program has lots of instructions which are to be executed only in certain situations.

Conditionals may be best illustrated with a flowchart. Take a look at the following example:

Such a flow as shown in the flowchart can only be created by conditionals. The diamond in the flowchart indicates a decision point which can be answered with true or false. Depending on true or false the program runs differently. With this tool we can make our programs much more flexible in terms of decisions.
  
## If statement
  
Such structures are implemented in most programming languages by the if statement.
