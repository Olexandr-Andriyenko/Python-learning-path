# Object oriented programming

In software development, object orientation (OO for short) is a view of complex systems in which a system is described by the interaction of cooperating objects. 
The term object is not very clear, the only important thing about an object is that it has certain attributes (properties) and methods assigned to it and that it is able to receive messages from other objects or send messages to them.
Object orientation is mostly used in the context of object-oriented programming to reduce the complexity of the resulting programs.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a common paradigm that is now used to program in almost all languages. And it's the one that almost every major software project is based on these days; sometimes more, sometimes less.
In object-oriented programming, the code is separated into "objects". Its opposite is procedural programming, in which a sequence of code is processed piece by piece.

Because object orientation is very similar to human thinking, this programming style can also be used very intuitive by a human programmer. So it is an easy concept for humans to understand and apply, as it is based on our natural human thinking.
