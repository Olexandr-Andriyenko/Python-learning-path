# Object oriented programming

## Introduction

In software development, object orientation (OO for short) is a view of complex systems in which a system is described by the interaction of cooperating objects. 
The term object is not very clear, the only important thing about an object is that it has certain attributes (properties) and methods assigned to it and that it is able to receive messages from other objects or send messages to them.
Object orientation is mostly used in the context of object-oriented programming to reduce the complexity of the resulting programs.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a common paradigm that is now used to program in almost all languages. And it's the one that almost every major software project is based on these days; sometimes more, sometimes less.
In object-oriented programming, the code is separated into "objects". Its opposite is procedural programming, in which a sequence of code is processed piece by piece.

<br>
Because object orientation is very similar to human thinking, this programming style can also be used very intuitive by a human programmer. So it is an easy concept for humans to understand and apply, as it is based on our natural human thinking.

An object is an exact description for example of our pen. The attributes (properties) have a value or a fixed state. For example, our pen had the outer color white and the writing color black. The class, on the other hand, is a generalization of all pen objects. It describes which attributes a pen can have without assigning a value to them. Only the object represents the thing pen, which we have in front of us with all its properties.

Another example is the "Human" class. Even before birth, we know which characteristics (e.g. eye color, size, gender) and functions (e.g. speaking) a person will later have, but we do not know what value they have. A single person then corresponds to an object of the class "human" (even if the term object is perhaps a bit misplaced in this context), whose properties are set at creation (e.g. eye color=brown).

In object-oriented programming, each object belongs to a class. This has the attributes (properties) and the methods (interactions) of this class.
