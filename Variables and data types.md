# Variables and data types

A variable can be understood as a container that is used to store data. In mathematics, variables are placeholders for numbers, but here not only numbers, but also strings, symbols and other data can be stored in a variable. In the process of a program, data of variables is being accessed and manipulated or replaced by new data.

A variable can be of a certain data type and have a value. There are different data types in python that are important to know. Depending on the data type of a variable, only certain values can be stored in a variable. 

| Datatype      | Abbreviation  | Meaning                 | Example for a value   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------| ----------------------|
| Integer       | int           | Whole number            | 42                    |
| Float         | float         | Real number             | 3.1415                |
| String        | str           | Sequence of characters  | "name, age, gender"   |
| Boolean       | bool          | Truth values            | True (1) or False (0) |


The variable name must be set for the definition of variables. For this purpose, some rules and conventions should be observed. Variable names should always be clearly specified so that the purpose of a variable is later understood. If a variable is used to store book titles, then it should logically be called "book_title" and not "b_t" or similar. If a variable name consists of different words, you should separate them with an underscore " _ ".
