# Introducing Functions

Everyone had heard something about functions in their school days. If you do not remember the exact topic from the mathematics class it is not a problem. Because the functions in mathematics compared to the functions in programming are quite different. Until now, it was not exactly said what functions are, but we had already used them anyway, for example the print()-, input()-, int()-, float()- and str()-function. A function is often recognized by its identifier(name of the function) followed by round brackets. In the round brackets we enter data so that they are processed somehow. A function can be imagined as a box that has an input and an output. Data goes into the input if this "box". They are processed in this "box" by specific operations which modify the data in some way. At the output, the processed data is returned, having some initial state due to the working steps.
