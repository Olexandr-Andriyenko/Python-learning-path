# Type conversion/casting

Type conversion in computer science is the conversion of one data type into another data type. A distinction is made between explicit and implicit type conversion.

## Implicit type conversion

In implicit type conversion, Python automatically converts one data type to another data type. This process does not require the participation of the programmer. With the "type()" function you can display the data type of a variable, to be more precise of an object.
