# Python-learning-path
This is a documentation about my learning progress in python.<br>
All topics which are listed here, I have described in detail and worked out by myself.<br>
Feel free to learn python easiely by my roadmap beginer friendly.<br>

## General information

Because the best way to learn a programming language is by practical application, I will mostly avoid theoretical descriptions.<br>
In this chapter I will only go into the most necessary details to gain a first insight into the Python programming language.<br>
After all, a programming language is first and foremost a tool to solve different problems.<br>
But before we use this tool for problem solving, we have to learn more about this tool.<br>
For now, let's answer the first question: [What is python?](https://github.com/Olexandr-Andriyenko/Python-learning-path/blob/main/What%20is%20python.md).
