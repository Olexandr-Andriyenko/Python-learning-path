# What is python

Python is one of the most successful programming languages of our time, because it can be used in basically all fields of knowledge: 
Mathematics, science, technology and even art. Besides, Python is a so-called higher programming language. To understand what exactly this means, we must first understand what a programming language is. 

In general, a language can be categorized into artificial and natural languages.
Natural language is a language "spoken" by humans, such as German and English.
The focus is on the expression of human thought and feeling.
It is therefore a means of communication between people, which is constantly evolving along with people.
Such a natural language is never developed by a single person, but by a totality of people sharing a common 
experience set with each other. Today, there are more than 6000 different natural languages known.
There are different theories how these natural languages had developed, but this is not relevant for us for now, 
because in computer science the artificial language plays a big role.
That is why we will take a closer look at artificial language to get deeper into the meaning of programming language.<br>

Artificial languages are also often called constructed languages because, unlike natural languages, they had not evolved in the progress of human history as a medium of communication between people, but were constructed for a specific purpose.
<br>
<br>
For example, secret languages have the purpose that only initiates understand the conversations among themselves.
For such a secret language, a "key" is designed that makes it possible to encode the messages between the initiates, for example, by shifting letters or replacing them with numbers. In the process of the programming exercises, we will learn about the so-called "Caesar cipher", which allows us to encode a message.
<br>
<br>
Another example of artificial languages are the fictional languages that are conceived as part of a fictional world.
They can be found mostly in movies, books or even computer games. If you've ever watched Star Trek, you're probably familiar with the fictional language Klingon.
Many other examples of artificial languages exist, but for us as programming enthusiasts, the formal language is of particular importance.
<br>
<br>
For the formal language there are many mathematical descriptions, which I will not go into for now, instead I will give you a simple description for the beginning, to get a basic overview. Formal languages have no meaning for interpersonal communication, their purpose is to enable an exact mathematical description or to describe the processing of data. Such a formal language is built from a certain set of symbol chains ("words" of a language), which can be composed from a character set ("alphabet" basic symbols). Perhaps in simpler terms: A formal language is composed of a set of words, which in turn is composed of characters of the alphabet of a language. The alphabet is the set of characters that is allowed to be used in a word. With such a formal language, a natural language can be modeled very well, because computers only work with formal languages. At some point you will come across the terms syntax and semantics in the context of languages. Syntax refers to the rules by which words of the language are constructed and semantics answers the question: What is the meaning of these words?

Since we already know that Python is a programming language, we can already answer the following question with the previous knowledge: What actually is a programming language?<br> 

***A programming language is a formal language that is used to formulate algorithms and data structures that can be executed by the computer.***

<br>
<br>
An algorithm is the set of all steps which are necessary to solve a given problem. So an algorithm is a solution plan, according to which data are processed in such a way, that they lead to the desired result. Algorithms are the basis of programming and can be formulated independently of a chosen programming language. In order to formulate an algorithm, first of all you have to describe the problem which you want to solve.
<br>
As an example of an algorithm, let's take the following example as a problem statement:
<br>
How much wallpaper is needed, to completely cover a rectangular wall?
<br>
In order to solve this problem, we will now define separate steps, which will be executed step by step in order to master this issue:
<br>
  
1. Measure the width of the wall (input)
2. Measure the length of the wall (input)
3. Calculate the area by multiplying width with length (processing)
4. Pick out a wallpaper with the area from step three (output)

These four individual steps are necessary to solve the problem. The four individual steps combined as a whole are called an algorithm.
Such an algorithm can then be implemented in any programming language. In very general terms, an algorithm is a systematic, logical procedure of steps that leads to the solution of a problem. Such an algorithm can also be seen as a function, because input variables (width and length) are transformed into output variables (area), which represent the solution of the problem. Now it is left to explain what exactly a data structure is.
<br>
<br>
In computer science, data refers to certain information that has been translated into a particular format so that a computer can understand and process it.
Data such as videos, images, sounds or texts are represented as binary values with patterns of two numbers (0 and 1) inside the computer.
<br>
<br>
But these data must have some order in the computer. For this purpose the so-called data structures are available, this is understood as the organization of data in the memory of a computer. Data structures are important for organizing, processing, accessing and storing data. Over time, you will learn about different data structures and understand how to use them.
