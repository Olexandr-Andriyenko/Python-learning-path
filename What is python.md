# What is python

Python is one of the most successful programming languages of our time, because it can be used in basically all fields of knowledge: 
Mathematics, science, technology and even art. Besides, Python is a so-called higher programming language. To understand what exactly this means, we must first understand what a programming language is. 

In general, a language can be categorized into artificial and natural languages.
Natural language is a language "spoken" by humans, such as German and English.
The focus is on the expression of human thought and feeling.
It is therefore a means of communication between people, which is constantly evolving along with people.
Such a natural language is never developed by a single person, but by a totality of people sharing a common 
experience set with each other. Today, there are more than 6000 different natural languages known.
There are different theories how these natural languages had developed, but this is not relevant for us for now, 
because in computer science the artificial language plays a big role.
That is why we will take a closer look at artificial language to get deeper into the meaning of programming language.
