# What is python

Python is one of the most successful programming languages of our time, because it can be used in basically all fields of knowledge: 
Mathematics, science, technology and even art. Besides, Python is a so-called higher programming language. To understand what exactly this means, we must first understand what a programming language is. 

In general, a language can be categorized into artificial and natural languages.
Natural language is a language "spoken" by humans, such as German and English.
The focus is on the expression of human thought and feeling.
It is therefore a means of communication between people, which is constantly evolving along with people.
Such a natural language is never developed by a single person, but by a totality of people sharing a common 
experience set with each other.
