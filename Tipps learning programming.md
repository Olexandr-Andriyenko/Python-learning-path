# Tipps learning programming


If you want to learn programming, you have to read a lot. So get used to browsing books, forums and sample programs. Especially the forum "Stackoverflow" (https://stackoverflow.com/) should be used if you get stuck with a task, because there you can often find solutions and inspiration from other programmers.

If you have a specific goal for why you want to learn programming, you should create a learning plan from the beginning. It often helps a lot if you look for a so-called "roadmap" from the Internet for the selected area and stick to it.

You should have realistic expectations as a beginner. By this we mean that from the beginning, we will not develop a 3D game, but simple console-based programs, without a graphical interface. If you have too high expectations for your first programs at the beginning, you often end up frustrated and give up.

When learning programming you should be patient, it is not a sprint but a marathon. It is best to find the perfect learning speed for yourself, already 1 to 2 hours a day of consistent learning has more success than studying once a week for 10 hours.

You should always complete your learning units with projects and documentation of them as well, so that you understand the project in the future. Just reading books or watching videos often creates a false impression where you think you have understood everything and can implement it on your own. In practice, however, the opposite turns out to be true and the programmer cannot independently build a program from scratch. By continuously working on small to large projects, which are related to the last learning unit, you will deepen your knowledge and "really" study. Plus, you can use all those projects later on for job applications or add them on your resume to have conversation topics. Projects also increase the credibility that you have the necessary experience to work independently.

In programming, you will make mistakes all the time, so you should get comfortable with failure. You won't get and understand everything right away, this just takes time. It is important to try to find a solution independently, or with help despite the failure.
