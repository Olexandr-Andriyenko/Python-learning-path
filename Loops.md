# Loops

Loops are needed to repeatedly execute a block of code, also known as a loop body. Using loops we can have action executed several times until a specified condition is met. There are two types of loops in Python:<br>
- while loop
- for loop
<br>
The loop header determines the condition of the loop. The program code that is repeated in a loop is also called the loop body. As soon as the loop body has been processed, the condition can cause a jump to the beginning of the loop, so that the loop body is processed from the beginning.
<br>
<br>
Most often, loops work with variables that change during the process of the loop. If the value of a variable matches the defined condition in a While loop, the program terminates the loop. The variable can also be a counter that defines how long the loop should be processed.

## While loop

The idea behind Python while loops is that they execute one or more statements until a condition is true. Then the loop is terminated.

The while loop is illustrated in the following flowchart:
