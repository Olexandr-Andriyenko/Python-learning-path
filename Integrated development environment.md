# Integrated development environment


Now that Python is installed on the operating system, you could theoretically already start programming. Now the only question is where exactly is programming happening, in which software (environment) are the programs being written? In fact, it doesn't take much to get started creating a Python program. Under Windows, a simple text editor is already enough. To do this, you can for example, create a text document on the desktop using the right mouse button under "New".
